This is a school project for a Cryptography Class in my 4th year.

We had to do an Advanced Encryption Standard that was implemented using C. Since actual AES is quite large we used a simplified verion on it. This one used only a 16-bit system and an easier S-box encryption. 

Compile the C code and run.
